<h2>Grid Filter using jQuery</h2>
<p>I was working on a project which needed this functionality, so I worked through familiarizing myself with the jQuery methods needed to filter tiles on a grid. </p>
<p>jQuery methods used include fadeIn(), fadeOut(), addClass(), removeClass(), and performs looping over an array of "phases".</p>
